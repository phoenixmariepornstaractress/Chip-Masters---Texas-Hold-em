Dear C++ Developers,

I am reaching out to request your expertise in expanding a Texas Hold'em Poker game project written in C++. The current implementation includes basic game mechanics, player actions, and hand evaluations. However, we aim to enhance the project by incorporating advanced features such as AI opponents, betting strategies, a graphical user interface, and improved hand evaluation algorithms. Your contributions would be invaluable in refining and enriching this simulation, and I would greatly appreciate any insights or enhancements you could provide. Thank you for considering this opportunity to collaborate on making a comprehensive and engaging poker game.

Best regards,
